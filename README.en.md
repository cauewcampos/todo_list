<h2 id="description">üìå About</h2>
It's a web based application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript, allowing the creation of multiple users and their respective tasks. The users can be edited or deleted, and the information is stored locally in the browser's localStorage in JSON format. The stored data include: user.avatar, user.name, user.id and user.tasks. This project was created during my internship in Full Stack Development at UOL's Compass Scolarship.
